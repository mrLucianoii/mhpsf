  							<p>McGuinn, Hillsman &amp; Palefsky  is consistently recognized as one of the leading employment firms in the country and has been at the forefront of the fight for employee rights for the past 30 years.  The firm literally helped create the field of employment law and has been directly involved in many of the leading and precedent setting cases. We participated in the landmark decision of Tameny v Atlantic Richfield which was the first case in the country to recognize the tort of wrongful termination. The firm was instrumental in the development of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the workplace setting and has led the way in the application of the doctrine in the area of executive compensation and commission contracts. We won one of the first judgments in the country applying the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the workplace in Rulon-Miller v IBM and subsequently participated in the argument to California Supreme Court in Foley v Interactive Data which redefined the tort of wrongful termination and confirmed the existence of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every employment contract.</p><p>The firm handles all forms of private sector employment cases including termination, discrimination, harassment, whistleblower, wage and hour, breach of contract and False Claims Act cases. We litigate individual cases and class actions. We have significant experience representing senior executives in the high tech world and employees in the financial services and securities industries.</p><p>Chambers USA identified McGuinn, Hillsman &amp; Palefsky as the <a href="http://www.mhpsf.com/MHPSF/Chambers_%26_Partners.html">leading plaintiff side employment firm in California</a>. In February 2007 the <a href="http://www.mhpsf.com/MHPSF/Top_Northern_California_Law_Firms.html">Daily Journal named the firm as a leading Northern California</a> firm in the field of Employment Law.</p>

  				    	<p>Since opening our doors more than forty years ago McGuinn, Hillsman &amp; Palefsky has earned a national reputation for excellence and  built one of the West Coast’s premier maritime tort practices.  </p>
						<p>We represent people not corporations or insurance companies. From our base in San Francisco, we appear in State and Federal courts ranging from Seattle to San Diego and Honolulu to Fort Lauderdale in marine personal injury, wrongful death, products, collision, and pollution cases arising under the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, the Longshore Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Water Act, and general maritime law. We represent a wide variety of maritime clients including marine construction workers, dredgermen, divers, merchant seamen, tugboat hands, fishermen, longshoremen, shipyard workers, and cruise ship passengers.</p>
						<p>We represent our clients at every level of decision, all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and have helped shape and hone maritime law by taking on cutting edge cases, participating in key appeals, and authoring topical law review articles. We led the charge on break-through issues like “brown water” seaman status and non-traditional Longshore coverage and we are currently working to help frame the debate on the important question of maritime punitive damages.</p>	
						<p>But we are trial lawyers first and foremost. Our decades of experience and peer-rated preeminence before State and Federal juries have been recognized by several national organizations and publications including <a href="">Super Lawyers</a>, <a href="">The Best Lawyers in America</a>, <a href="">The Best Lawyers in Northern California</a>, <a href="">Martindale-Hubble</a>, the <a href="">American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA)</a> and the <a href="">American College of Trial Lawyers (ACTL)</a>.</p>
